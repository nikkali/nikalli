  - We make Fireworks!! Sometimes we actually get to use fireworks, and when we do, the people cheer! Lots of our signage, design, and marketing skills come in handy when our clients are putting on events.
  - Our business philosophy is basically on giant event all the time. Whether we are scheduling out an installation on several trailer wraps in Tupelo, MS or printing hundreds of banners for a senior celebration, we are always on a timeline and we work great with events!
  - We realized our knack for events Christmas 2018 when we pulled off the impossible light show, fireworks and we didnâ€™t even have time to do a run through. Our practice was OPENING NIGHT!!!
  - It was then that we looked back our our 20 year history of being in business and realized we were always planning the next event, either for ourselves, our community, or our clients
