  - Even if you started today, at some point you run out of possibilities.
  - At Relevant, we have One Zillion Possibilities because we have realized that out of all the possibilities, there is ONE that fits just right for you!
  - Our approach is unique in that we make things really simple. We don’t use big complicated words to describe what we do, who we are, and what you need.
  - We give our clients, specific, tangible steps to take to accomplish their project.
  - It was almost Christmas time and we decided for one of our events that we wanted dancing lights all over downtown Columbia. We were up for the challenge.
  - We ordered lighting controllers we had never touched before, mapped out of all the lights, and started programming the show with less than 30 days to show time. It’s a long story, but at the end, tens of thousands of cheers were heard from the streets on opening night as our light show led into a fireworks display that rivaled Disney!
